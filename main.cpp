//In this programming problem you'll code up Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm.
//
//Download the text file below.
//
//edges.txt
//This file describes an undirected graph with integer edge costs. It has the format
//
//[number_of_nodes] [number_of_edges]
//
//[one_node_of_edge_1] [other_node_of_edge_1] [edge_1_cost]
//
//[one_node_of_edge_2] [other_node_of_edge_2] [edge_2_cost]
//
//...
//
//For example, the third line of the file is "2 3 -8874", indicating that there is an edge connecting vertex #2 and vertex #3 that has cost -8874.
//
//You should NOT assume that edge costs are positive, nor should you assume that they are distinct.
//
//Your task is to run Prim's minimum spanning tree algorithm on this graph. You should report the overall cost of a minimum spanning tree --- an integer, which may or may not be negative --- in the box below.
//
//IMPLEMENTATION NOTES: This graph is small enough that the straightforward O(mn) time implementation of Prim's algorithm should work fine. OPTIONAL: For those of you seeking an
//additional challenge, try implementing a heap-based version. The simpler approach, which should already give you a healthy speed-up, is to maintain relevant edges in a heap (with
//keys = edge costs).
//The superior approach stores the unprocessed vertices in the heap, as described in lecture. Note this requires a heap that supports deletions, and you'll probably need to maintain
//some kind of
//mapping between vertices and their positions in the heap.
